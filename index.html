                <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
                <p><b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam </b>, popularly known as the "Missile Man of India," was one of the most
                    respected and inspiring figures in Indian history. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil
                    Nadu, he came from a humble background and rose to become a renowned scientist and the 11th
                    President of India. Kalam played a crucial role in India's space and missile development programs,
                    especially through his work with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the
                    Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was instrumental in the development of the Agni and
                    Prithvi missiles, which earned him national acclaim. As President from 2002 to 2007, he was widely
                    loved for his humility, integrity, and dedication to the nation. Beyond his scientific achievements,
                    Dr. Kalam was also a prolific writer and a passionate educator who encouraged young people to dream
                    big and work hard to achieve their goals. He believed strongly in the power of youth and education
                    to transform the future of a nation. His life remains a shining example of how determination, hard
                    work, and vision can lead to greatness. Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, but his legacy
                    continues to inspire millions across the world.</p>
